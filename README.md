# python-sdk-samples

This repo contains samples documenting basic operations with Azure Blob storage services in Python.

1. [storage-blob-resize-upload](https://github.com/samvaity/python-sdk-samples/tree/master/storage-blob-resize-upload) - This sample resizes an image to a thumbnail size of 128*128, creates a blob and uploads it to a storage container.
2. [storage-blob-trigger-function-app](https://github.com/samvaity/python-sdk-samples/tree/master/storage-blob-trigger-function-app) - This sample demonstrates a simple use case of processing data on Blobs that are uplaoded to a specific container(configurable) using Python.
